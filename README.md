# Handcrafted Datepicker made in Svelte

### Usage

```html
<Datepicker bind:value>label</Datepicker>
<!-- or when compiled as webcomponent  -->
<as-datepicker>label</as-datepicker>
```

My goal is to provide a Datepicker that can replace
`<input type="date">` that can be styled form the outside

### Todo

- fix bug: value form outside gets overwritten on init
- Positioning strategy, try out popperjs?
- Weekday Indicator
- Highlight current Day
- Highlight selected Day
- Option for value as JS Date or DateJS Date or other formats
- Locale format displays
- Have Button toggle, not only open
- Stylable form outside, optional included styles
  - make theme configurable from outside somehow for themes
  - or ad a dark option for now
- Animations
- Show dates from other months
- Min and Max Date
- Date Range Picker
