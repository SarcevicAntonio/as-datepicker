# Handcrafted Datepicker made in Svelte

### Usage

```html
<Datepicker bind:value>label</Datepicker>
```

My goal is to provide a Datepicker that can replace
`<input type="date">` that can be styled form the outside

### Todo

- Positioning strategy, try out popperjs?
- Weekday Indicator
- Highlight current Day
- Highlight selected Day
- Option for value as JS Date or DateJS Date
- Have Button toggle, not only open
- Web Component & Svelte Compatible (with ClickOutside)
- Stylable form outside, optional included styles
- -- make theme configurable from outside somehow for themes
- or ad a dark option for now
